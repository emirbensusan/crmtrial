## 🔧 Production Setup

### Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Security Configuration
```typescript
// Rate limiting configuration
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(5, 15 * 60 * 1000); // 5 attempts per 15 minutes

// File upload security
const uploadConfig = {
  maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
  allowedTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'],
  allowedExtensions: ['.jpg', '.png', '.pdf']
};
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Track API performance
const monitor = PerformanceMonitor.getInstance();
await monitor.measureAsync('api-call', () => fetchData());

// Monitor Web Vitals
measureWebVitals(); // Automatically tracks LCP, FID, CLS
```

## 🧪 Testing
